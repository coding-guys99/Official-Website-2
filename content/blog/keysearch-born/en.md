## Opening: Chaotic Daily Life

Everyone has experienced situations like these:
- Files you organized yesterday are nowhere to be found today.  
- Inspirations noted down in notebooks, phones, or emails vanish when needed.  
- In the middle of work, time is spent not on "creating" but on "searching."  

These fragmented moments gradually add up to the biggest hidden cost in our daily lives: spending more time finding things than doing things.

## Discovery of the Problem

At first, like most people, I relied on built-in computer search or traditional tools.  
They could help me find files, but not organize information.  

The result: more and more files, messier and messier notes, data that "exists" but lacks "order."  

At that moment, a thought came to me:

**What if a search tool not only helped you find files, but also organized them into cards?**

## The Birth of KeySearch

And so, KeySearch was born.  
It’s not just a "search tool," but a "card-based knowledge search system":

- Every piece of information can become a card.  
- Not only filenames, but also content, tags, and types can be searched.  
- Cards can be sorted, edited, and exported — making information visible, organized, and reusable.  

During the design process, I stuck to a few core principles:
- **Speed**: Search must be instant.  
- **Simplicity**: Operation must be intuitive.  
- **Aesthetics**: Black-gold design brings quality.  
- **Globalization**: Multi-language support for users of all cultural backgrounds.

## Who It’s For

KeySearch is designed for:
- Students and researchers organizing study materials  
- Creators preserving ideas and collecting references  
- Engineers managing files and code snippets  
- Multilingual users working across cultures  

In short, KeySearch gives everyone overwhelmed by information a simpler way forward.

## The Road Ahead

KeySearch now offers a **Web version (free trial)** and **Donate support**.  
Next, we will launch a **Desktop version (Windows/macOS)** and plan a **Pro version** with stronger indexing, syncing, and advanced features.  

This journey continues, but the mission remains:

**Make information simpler, not more complicated.**
