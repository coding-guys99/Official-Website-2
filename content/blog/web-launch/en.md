Every day we deal with various types of information: files, paths, links, notes, to-dos.  
The problem is, when these pieces are scattered everywhere, finding them quickly always wastes time.  

To solve this, **KeySearch Web is officially launched**.  
No installation required — just open your browser and experience a whole new way of **card-based search**.
