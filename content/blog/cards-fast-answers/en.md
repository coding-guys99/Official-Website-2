We search for information every day: files, notes, links, even past research records.  
Traditional search tools (like Everything, Listary) can help you *find files*, but often fail to *organize information*.  
**The birth of KeySearch is to bridge this gap.**

## Advantages and Limitations of Traditional Search Tools

- **Everything**: Extremely fast filename search, but limited to filenames and lacks content or context.  
- **Listary**: Quick program launcher and directory switcher, but not suitable for knowledge management.  
- **Common limitations:**
  - Cannot handle scattered content (notes, links)  
  - Lacks cross-platform and multi-language support  
  - Files can be found but not organized

## A Different Approach: KeySearch

KeySearch is not just a file searcher — it’s **card-based knowledge search**:

- **Card view**: Turn files, notes, links, and annotations into clear cards  
- **Fast search**: Search beyond filenames, including content and tags  
- **Sorting & editing**: Organize by time/title/type, and edit directly in cards  
- **Export & backup**: CSV/JSON support for cross-device or team sharing  
- **Multi-language interface**: Framework for 16 languages

## Who Is It For?

- **Researchers / Students**: Need to manage large volumes of PDFs, notes, and references  
- **Creators / Designers**: Handle scattered ideas, want fast categorization and retrieval  
- **Engineers / Project Managers**: Record paths, code snippets, and project documents  
- **Multi-language users**: Require cross-language interface and global usability

## Future Outlook

- Windows / macOS desktop apps  
- Pro version (enhanced indexing, sync, advanced query syntax)

The mission of KeySearch is not just to *help you find files*,  
but to *help you organize knowledge and find answers*.
