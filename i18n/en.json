    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "What‚Äôs the difference between KeySearch and Everything?",
    "a1": "Everything is an ultra-fast file name search tool, focused on finding file names. KeySearch not only searches file names, but also turns data into cards, supporting content, tags, and category search, with CSV/JSON export. In short: Everything finds files, KeySearch organizes information.",
    "q2": "What‚Äôs the difference between KeySearch and Listary?",
    "a2": "Listary focuses on being a ‚Äúlauncher + file dialog integration,‚Äù making it easy to quickly open programs or jump directories. KeySearch is a ‚Äúcard-based knowledge search‚Äù: besides files, you can also save notes, links, research content, and manage them with tags and sorting. Listary speeds up launching, KeySearch helps you record and retrieve.",
    "q3": "Which platforms does KeySearch support?",
    "a3": "Currently a Web Demo is available and can be used directly in the browser. Windows/macOS desktop versions are under development (Coming Soon).",
    "q4": "Which languages are supported?",
    "a4": "KeySearch has a built-in framework for 16 languages. The initial release supports English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Malay. Other languages will be added step by step based on demand.",
    "q5": "Will my data be uploaded? How is privacy protected?",
    "a5": "In the Web version, data is stored locally in the browser (LocalStorage/IndexedDB), and will not be uploaded automatically. In the future, if cloud sync is introduced, it will be encrypted and you can decide whether to enable it.",
    "q6": "Can I back up or take my data with me?",
    "a6": "Yes. KeySearch provides CSV/JSON export, making it easy to back up, transfer, or use across devices.",
    "q7": "Does it cost money now?",
    "a7": "The Web version is completely free for now, with Donate support available. A Pro version will be released in the future with desktop apps and advanced features, along with a clear pricing plan."}
